Instructions for installing DiGS-v2.0 (with ILDG browser)

untar DiGS-v2.0-src.tar
cd DiGS-v2.0-src

edit Makefile 
  - set up correct $GLOBUS_LOCATION and $GLOBUS_RLS_LOCATION

set up PATH
  - source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh
  - source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-devel-env.sh
  (and if installed with VDT)
  - source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
  - export $QCDGRID_HOME to point to the installation directory (export QCDGRID_HOME=`pwd`)

building client
  - make client
  - cd java
  - edit $BROWSER_HOME in java/ildg-browser/setClasspath.sh to point to ildg-browser directory
  - source ildg-browser/setenv.sh
  - ./compile.sh

  - copy nodes.conf and nodeprefs.conf from previous installation of qcdgrid/DiGS

building storage node
  - make storagenode

  - set up data storage directories (as in previous installation of qcdgrid/DiGS)

building server
  - make server

  - copy qcdgrid.conf, mainnodelist.conf, deadnodes.conf, disablednodes.conf and retiringnodes.conf from the old installation


setup the system for ILDG users (only necessary for storage nodes and the control node)
  - cd tools/setupFiles

  first set up the $QCDGRID_PATH variable in the file changePermissions.pl
  then do the following as root:
  set up the appropriate permissions on files
  - ./changePermissions.pl
  

  configuration of pooled acounts
  - mkdir /etc/grid-security/gridmapdir
  export GRIDMAPDIR=/etc/grid-security/gridmapdir
  (ideally put this line on top of $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh or $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh)
  make sure that the UIDs specified in the scripts addILDGusers.sh and addUKQusers.sh will not clash with the already existing ones.
  - ./addILDGusers.sh
  - ./addUKQusers.sh
  - cp cleanILDGusers.sh /etc/cron.hourly
  - cp cleanUKQusers.sh /etc/cron.hourly
  - restart gridftp and gatekeeper for changes to take effect

  install new version of VOMS
  - cd $QCDGRID_HOME/tools/edg
  - change paths in cgm-crontask and create-grid-mapfile
  - run create-grid-mapfile and see if new grid-mapfile was generated with '.ukq' and '.ild' mappings
  - cp cgm-crontask to /etc/cron.daily (replace the previous installation)

other configuration tasks

  install automatic updates of Certificate Revocation List
  - as root: cp $QCDGRID_HOME/tools/updateCRLcrontask /etc/cron.daily

Testing the installation:

  - run as a normal user (with your proxy): digs-test-setup
  - or, if on control node, run as qcdgrid user
