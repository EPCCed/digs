Storage Element Test Suite
==========================
The test suite consists of 2 executables: runAllTests, which actually runs the
tests and reports the results, and setup-se-test which sets up the environment
ready for running the tests. To use the test suite:

 1. Edit setest.conf and customise the values for the SE being tested

 2. Run setup-se-test to set up the environment ready for testing. It looks for
    setest.conf in the current directory, or you can pass an alternative config
    file path on the command line

 3. Run runAllTests to perform the tests. Again it looks for setest.conf in the
    current directory or in the location given on the command line

There is a limitation of this system; the test suite expects some files and
directories to be in place on the SE when the tests start. In order to create
this file structure, the setup program must use the SE interface itself to
access the storage. This means that the setup program may fail if the SE adaptor
is buggy, and it may not be possible to run the test suite in order to debug it.
This can be worked around by creating the required file structure on the SE (see
the source code of setup-se-test for what this structure should be) manually
using a different client tool.
