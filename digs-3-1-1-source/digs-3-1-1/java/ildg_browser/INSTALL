================================================

1. Unzip and untar the distribution.
2. Change to the ildgbrowser directory.
3. Edit the setenv.sh (setenv.bat on Windows) script so that the
   value of the BROWSER_HOME variable to point to
   $INSTALL_DIR/ildgbrowser.
   For example, if you unzipped the distribution in /opt/qcdgid,
   BROWSER_HOME should be /opt/qcdgrid/ildgbrowser.
4. Source the setenv.sh script (or run setenv.bat on Windows)
5. Edit the browser.properties file to add the password 
   required for the browser central data repository. This is
   available from the UKQCD team.
6. Obtain a copy of the Services.xml file. This is usually 
   available from: 
   http://www.lqcd.org/ildg/Services.xml
   Edit this so it contains details of the services you wish to
   search. 
7. Edit the browser.properties file so that the 
   services.file.location property points to the services file
   location.
8. Optionally, you can configure the operation of the browser
   by setting the queryrunner.maxresults property value. This
   determines whether queries are issued against each service
   in on large query (value = 0 or less), or in a batch of 
   subqueries, each returning this number of results. This can
   be useful when issuing queries that return a large number 
   of results.
9. Run the browser using the rungui.sh (or, on Windows, rungui.bat)
   script. Full instructions are available in the user manual.
