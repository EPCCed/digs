First please set up the following paths in the file createGridmapFile.py:

  config['email'] = 'your.email@x.ac.uk'
  config['ukqcd'] = 'ukqcd' #desired mapping in the grid-mapfile for UKQCD members
  config['ildg'] = 'ildg' #desired mapping in the grid-mapfile for ILDG members    
  config['gridmapfile'] = '/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile'
  config['gridmapfilelocal'] = '/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile-local'
  config['gridmapfileold'] = '/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile-old'
  config['key'] = '/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem'
  config['cert'] = '/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem'

then run it as root like this:

  python createGridmapFIle.py
 
Note, that this operation should happen frequently. We recommend to set up a cron job which executes this task at least once a day.
